    <b>Project Overview:</b> The Get Next Line project is an exercise in the 42 school curriculum that challenges students to create a function in C which reads a line from a file descriptor. This project is instrumental in understanding file operations and memory management in C.<br><br>
    <b>Key Features:</b> The function, get_next_line, is capable of reading from a file or standard input and returning one line at a time, efficiently managing memory and handling multiple file descriptors simultaneously.<br><br>
    <b>Installation:</b> Clone the repository and compile the project to integrate it into C programs requiring line-by-line reading capabilities.
